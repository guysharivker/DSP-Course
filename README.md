# DSP-Course
As part of an introductory signal processing course at the university, we were asked to do a project on signal processing that combines sound processing and the use of adaptive filters.

# PART A:
In a hall measuring 30x30 meters, a resonance is created whose transit time is 0.1 seconds. In each encounter with the wall the return intensity is 0.5 and the phase is 180 degrees.
In addition there is a noise (generated before the resonance) Gaussian concentrated around 600 Hz with a standard deviation of 200 Hz. The noise level is 10% of the 
signal strength.
    1. Create a shock response that characterizes the resonance. Stop the reaction when the resonance intensity drops below 10%.
    2. Record two audio clips in your voice tonight.
    3.Add the Gaussian noise to both - Upload the source files and the files with the noise.
    4. Add the Resonance - Upload the files.
    5.Use lms prepared on one of the files to clean both Upload:
        A. The cleaned files
        B. The report states the filter coefficients.
 # PART B:
    1. Duplicate one of the original files from section 2 in the cosine at 150 Hz.
    2. Pass it in a high-pass filter with a trimmer at 200 Hz - upload the file
    3. Add the noise and resonance and upload the file.
    4. Recover the file using rls filter - and upload the recovered file
